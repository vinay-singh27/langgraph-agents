# langgraph-agents
Overview

LangGraph Agents utilize the MessageGraph framework to define interactive workflows between nodes (representing tasks) and edges (representing logic for transitions). These agents can be extended or customized for diverse applications such as:

- Automated dialogue systems
- Dynamic message handling
- Reflective data generation

- This repository is modular and supports adding multiple agents. Each agent has a well-defined structure, making it easy to integrate into your projects.
